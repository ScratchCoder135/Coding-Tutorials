Let's learn about _hacking_.

Hacking is a way that people use to get the access to computers and databases.They can get any info that they need,such as credit card numbers,user passwords and computer-generated data.

Terminal
```bash
echo $Hackeddata
```

Output
```
USERNAME:iamTheMiso
PASSWORD:user13579qwerty
CREDITCARD_NUM:4242424242424242
CREDIT_CARD_CVV:123
CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRE:12/2034
```

-----------------------------------------------
A common way to hack is to use SQL injection,which allows you to see the data in the database

index.html
```html
<input name="SuperSecretId">
```

Output:
```
USERNAME:GOODLE
PASSWORD:DOOGBB

USERNAME:SERv89
PASSWORD:49w2qw

```
