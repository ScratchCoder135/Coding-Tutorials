# ❤This is where you can upload your tutorials.

❗Pay attention to the following items:

1.✈We recommend that you go and download an app called Mimo and try it,our tutorials use the same design and same way as it.

2.**🗺No images,please!** Our tutorials have drawings,but you are not needed to help drawing the images,we will do that.

3.🔢Always mention a page structure

Like when you are designing a page of code exercise:
Please provide:
- ✔Code selection
- ❓suggested solution
- 🕳position of the input area

📟Example:
-------------------------
Assign 2 to the variable `amount` and 3 to ther variable `a`

```js
const $$=2
const $$=3
```
Selections:
[amount][amnt][a]


Solution:amount,a

(use $$ to represent input area)

--------------------------------
🔮When creating a coding exercise which user have to type their answer,also make the input area,but do not provide solutions.

✅When making Multiple choice questions,declare each choices.
