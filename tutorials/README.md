# This is where you can upload your tutorials.

Pay attention to the following items:

1.We recommend that you go and download an app called Mimo and try it,our tutorials use the same design and same way as it.

2.**No images,please!** Our tutorials have drawings,but you are not needed to help drawing the images,we will do that.

3.Always mention a page structure

Like when you are designing a page of code exercise:
Please provide:
- Code selection
- suggested solution
- position of the input area

Example:
-------------------------
Assign 2 to the variable `amount` and 3 to ther variable `a`

```js
const $$=2
const $$=3
```
Selections:
[amount][amnt][a]


Solution:amount,a

(use $$ to represent input area)

--------------------------------
When creating a coding exercise which user have to type their answer,also make the input area,but do not provide solutions.

When making Multiple choice questions,declare each choices.
